1. Colors _Pro-tip: Use the [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages._
   * Main header background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main header border color: `#cccccc`
   * Main content border color: `#dddddd`


3. Profile Image Found on `index.html`:
   * Use a picture of yourself.
   * If you don't have a picture, you can grab a placeholder image from [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). Save the images to your `images` folder.

4. Portfolio Images:
   * Placeholder images can be found at [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/).
   * Save the images to your `images` folder.

5. Background Images:
   * The background pattern used was found on [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/). You can browse through that site and find whichever pattern you like.

6. Dimensions:
   * The entire content and the main section content area is `960px` wide.
   * Pro-tip: Use the [Page Ruler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jlpkojjdgbllmedoapgfodplfhcbnbpn/related?hl=en) extension to measure the size of elements.

### Bonus

1. Make your pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, to image links, and to buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them. A CSS hover tutorial can be found [here](http://www.codeitpretty.com/2013/06/how-to-use-css-hover-effects.html).

2. You can use [Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to find colors that match the theme (in this case, the primary color is Teal `#4aaaa5`).

3. Make a "sticky footer." You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:
   * Try to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. A sticky footer tutorial can be found [here](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/).

### Helpful Hints

* For help with Git and GitHub, be sure to consult the GitHub Supplemental Guide sent to you in class.

* Don't forget to look into these concepts: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.

* This will be a tough assignment, but 23 weeks from now, you'll look back to this exercise and realize just how much you've grown as a developer. Stay positive! You've got this!

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit the link to the Github Repository!
